# The First Aether Dimension (Minecraft mod)
**(NOTE: NeoForge is going to be the only modloader supported, as of now)**
 

 

**There are a LOT of Aether mods out there.**

 

A scrapped dimension idea became one of the most popoular mods in the Minecraft community. But this mods are user-made, and they're probably not as the real one should be. Well, NOT THIS ONE! I browsed trought Minecraft old versions and I found some original Aether files in the textures, so I recreated them and made... The Real Aether Mod!

**FEATURES**

As everybody knows, you make the Aether portal using Glowstone. BUT HOW DO YOU IGNITE IT? The original idea wasn't using the Water Bucket, but something different.

Take a crafting table, place three blocks of Glowstone in the third line, put a Flint and Steel in the middle slot of the second line and BOOM! Aether Igniter acquired.

I also added the Super Glowstone Dust, that is obtainable by putting a Glowstone block in the middle slot of the second line. Using the Super Glowstone Dust you can make armour and tools.

There's also the Glowing Carrot! A super food made by putting a carrot and a Glowstone block on a Crafting Table.



This mod hasn't got any dependencies. Thank you for reading this, and of course enjoy!
